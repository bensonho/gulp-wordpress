wordpress theme
==============

(Currently still in development)

This script aims to improve the process of creating a wordpress theme from scratch by providing a few subjective conventions that make theme development a bit more enjoyable and also the end product of the theme optimized for use.

List of features:

* An intuitive structure for organizing files, which compile to the correct wordpress structure.
* Coffeescript and SCSS, concatenization and minification.
* Ability to include css bower libraries
* Image optimisation both for asset and upload files.
* My personal library of wordpress based utility/helper functions automatically included.
